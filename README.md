# p2-repositories

This project is a composite p2 repository that is a collection of the OSGI plugin repositories listed below.

To install any of the plugins, add the following URL to the list of available software sites in eclipse.

```
https://rawgit.com/markroyer/p2-repositories/master
```

This can be acheived by selecting *Help->"Install New Software..."* and then selecting the *Add* button next to the dropdown list of repository locations.

## Available Libraries

As this collection grows, I will try to create a complete list of librarires in this readme.
